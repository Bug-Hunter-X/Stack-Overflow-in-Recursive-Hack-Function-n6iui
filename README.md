# Stack Overflow Bug in Hack

This repository contains a simple Hack program that demonstrates a common programming error: a stack overflow caused by uncontrolled recursion.  The program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.  However, it lacks error handling for negative input, leading to infinite recursion and a stack overflow.

A solution is provided that addresses the stack overflow issue by adding input validation.
